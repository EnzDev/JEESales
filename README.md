# JEESales / Le Bon JEE

> This was a school project to get my hand into JEE. This does not reflect my current Java/JEE skills.

This is a classified advertisements website school project. The name is inspired from "Le Bon Coin" a French classified advertisements website.
The aim of this website were to get my hands on basic JEE features like `Servlets`, `JSP` or `Filters` and also basic testing.

It features administration, registration and basics ads repporting/publishing/canceling.
